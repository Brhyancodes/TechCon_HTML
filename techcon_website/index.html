            <p>It is with great pleasure that we announce TECHCON 2024 will be held September 8-10, 2024 at the Renaissance Hotel in Austin, Texas.â€¯This is a great networking opportunity! TECHCON is a competitive conference with an acceptance rate of roughly 30%. Please note that acceptance to TECHCON is not solely based on technical content. Other factors, such as proximity to graduation date, may influence selection which allows TechCon to create the most robust conference experience possible. Graduate students who have recently graduated or are within a year of graduation are often selected because members are looking to hire Research Scholars. This event is hosted for the benefit of sponsoring companies and supported TechCon Research Scholars.

Selection will be by industry committee review on a competitive basis. Authors will be notified of the committee's decision via email sometime in June. </p>
